In orchestration mode Raftt is responsible for spawning and managing ephemeral dev envs, and providing a great developer experience while using them.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"cli_reference":{"id":"cli_reference","title":"CLI Reference","description":"In this document, you can find the full list of Raftt CLI commands and usage information.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"concepts/containers":{"id":"concepts/containers","title":"Raftt\'s Containers","description":"Raftt runs your containers but slightly modifies the container behavior to improve the development experience.
